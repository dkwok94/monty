*Monty 0.98 Interpreter*

The objective of this project was to build a Monty 0.98 scripting language interpreter to handle various commands to manipulate stacks and queues.

The commands coded into the interpretor are as follows:

push [Usage: push #] - pushes # onto the stack. # is an integer value

pall - prints the stack contents starting from the top

pint - prints the first element on the top of the stack

pop - deletes the top element of the stack

swap - swaps the first two elements of the stack

add - adds the first two elements of the stack

nop - does not do anything to the stack
